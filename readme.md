# MATH10064 Multivariate Data Analysis - Assignment 3

## Project Overview

This repository contains the R script, data, and output plots for Assignment 3 of the MATH10064 Multivariate Data Analysis course at the University of Edinburgh. The assignment focuses on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster Analysis (k-means, hierarchical), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to a gene expression dataset.

The dataset originates from an experiment using adipocyte mouse cell cultures to model human fat tissues in the context of type 2 diabetes research. It investigates the effects of Insulin and Metformin treatments on gene expression over time (0h, 2h, 12h) compared to untreated control cells.

*(Note: The `outputs/` directory contains copies of the plots generated by the script. The script itself currently saves plots to `~/Desktop/` by default - see Usage section).*

## Data

* `data/Assignment3_Data.RData`: This file contains the necessary R objects for the assignment, including:
    * `data3T3`: Log-transformed gene expression matrix (Genes x Samples).
    * `time.names`: Vector of time points for samples.
    * `treatment.names`: Vector of treatment labels for samples.
    * `replicate.names`: Vector of replicate labels for samples.

This file was provided as part of the course materials.

## Requirements

The analysis requires R and the following packages:

* `ggplot2`
* `dplyr`
* `tidyr`
* `factoextra`
* `cluster`
* `MASS`
* `RColorBrewer`

You can install missing packages using `install.packages("package_name")`.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd xiongshizhao-UoE-Multivariate-Data-Analysis
    ```
2.  **Place Data:** Ensure the `Assignment3_Data.RData` file is located inside the `data/` directory.
3.  **Install Packages:** Launch R or RStudio and install any missing packages listed above.
4.  **Set Working Directory:** Make sure your R session's working directory is the root of the cloned repository folder. You can use `setwd("path/to/repository")` in R.
5.  **Run Script:** Execute the analysis script:
    ```R
    source("script/assignment_script.R")
    ```
6.  **Outputs:**
    * The script will print messages, summaries, and tables to the R console.
    * Plots (Plot 1 through Plot 12) will be displayed and saved as PNG files. **Note:** The `ggsave` commands in the current script save plots to `~/Desktop/`. You may want to modify the file paths within the `ggsave` commands in `assignment_script.R` to save them directly to the `outputs/` directory or another preferred location.

## Report

The analyses performed by this script support the generation of a formal statistical report as required by Assignment 3. The report should detail the findings from data exploration, PCA, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis, following the assignment guidelines and potentially UKSA standards for statistical reports.
